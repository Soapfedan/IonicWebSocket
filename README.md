# IonicWebSocket
This project was done to understand the interaction through websocket between an Ionic application and a PHP server.

The application has been implemented through the rxjs library


### Start the applications


If you want to start the client side, that's a Ionic app, you have to type in your prompt, the command *ionic serve*. For more details check the ionic Doc https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/serve/

The server app is even simpler than the client-side. You have to type *php server.php*.
